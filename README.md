thOth
=====

thOth is an open-source high frequency trading library in C++.

It comes as a cross-plateform library with addin support, database connectivity and a separate MFC GUI.

Ultimately, thOth is meant to support C++11 multi-threading as well as GPGPU programming.

The core library strongly relies on Boost, but additional dependencies might also be considered.

The current version only supports MSVC 2013 and Eclipse/gcc.
